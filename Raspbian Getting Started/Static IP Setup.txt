If you are planning to consistently use xrdp to connect to your pi, you may want
to set a static IP address. To set up a static IP address perform the following 
steps:
	1. Open a Terminal instance.
	2. Enter "ipconfig"
	3. If you want to use your ethernet port look under "eth0", if you are using
	   a wifi connection look under "wlan0".
	4. Write down the information in the fields "inet addr", "Bcast", and 
	   "Mask".
	   - inet addr is the device's current IP address.
	   - Bcast is the broadcast IP range.
	   - Mask is the subnet mask address.
	5. Enter "netstat -nr"
	6. Write down the information in the "Gateway" field.
	   - Use the fields that have values in them.
	7. Enter "cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces-backup".
	8. Enter "sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces".
	9. In the nano editor, make the file mimic the following format:
		 ___________________________________________________________________
		|																	|
		| auto lo 															|
		| iface lo inet loopback											|
		|																	|
		| iface default inet static											|
		| address "inet addr"												|
		| netmask "Mask"													|
		| broadcast "Bcast"													|
		| gateway "Gateway"													|
		|																	|
		| allow-hotplug wlan0												|
		| iface wlan0 inet manual											|
		| wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf					|
		| iface default inet dhcp											|
		|___________________________________________________________________|
		
	   - Areas encapsulated in quotations (") are where you input the values of 
	     the fields you wrote down earlier.
	   - With the IP addresses, the last number in the series can be anything 
	     you want less than 255. The first three numbers, must stay the same as 
	     the first three as your Gateway.
